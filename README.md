# QuickPass
A strong password generator in the manner of CorrectBatteryHorseStaple :)

# Demo
There is a demo of this hosted at: http://www.jaruzel.com/apps/quickpass/

# About
This is a strong password generator that unlike the passwords generated by most Password Managers, which are typically long random strongs of difficult to type characters, this generates strong passwords, that may be easier to type or remember. It's mostly inspired by the classic https://xkcd.com/936/.

The passwords are generated server-side via a small PHP script, you can see the source code on GitHub. I've written it this way, as a) I'm not that great with javascript, and b) some people like to have javascript turned off.

The HTML used is as basic as I can make it, so that it is responsive and lightweight.
